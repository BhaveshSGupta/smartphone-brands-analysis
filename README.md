smartphone-brands-analysis
==========================

First of all I fetched about 15000 tweets containing specific keywords related to smartphones by using twitter streaming API.

Then using Alchemy API,I collected sentiment scores of smartphone related keywords.

Then using highcharts.js, 
  1.  Display pie chart of tweets percentage of brands.
  2.  Display bar graph with positive, negative and neutral sentiment % of each brand.
  3.  Display of average sentiment score of each brand in bar graph.
